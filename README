Essentially an HTTPS proxy built to deal with TLS/SSL for clients who can't.


Requirements
============
    - PHP >= 5.4.0
    - cURL >= 7.18.1 built with OpenSSL


Usage
=====
    Copy 'config.example.php' to 'config.php' and set sensible values. Keep in
    mind that to prevent abuses you must set up a secret.

        $ php dessl.php <url>

    Request proxy:
        Use the generated URL with deSSL Proxy.
